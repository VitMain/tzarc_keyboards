# Djinn Split Keyboard

The Djinn is a 64-key split keyboard -- dual 4x7 with a 4-key thumb cluster. It also has a 5-way tactile switch under the thumb.

Extravagance-wise, it's got audio, encoder support, per-key RGB and RGB underglow... and a 240x320 LCD.

It also runs [QMK](https://qmk.fm/)! It's just.... not in the main repo, yet.

Unfortunately, the Djinn isn't currently supported in QMK's master, as it's running on hardware that's a bit too new. It's also intended to be used as a testbed for QMK features as well as one of the major drivers for upgrading ChibiOS. In due course it'll hit QMK master, but for now it needs to live outside.
